# Lorenzo's Dog Training Team — DO-NOT-BREAK

Written 2026-09-02 (Claude) from verified live state, before the trainer-deals build.
Copy also lives at the repo root. Update both.

**Live:** lorenzosdogtrainingteam.com · Vercel `ldtt-site` · deployed by hand with
`npx vercel deploy --prod` from `~/Desktop/codex-playground/lorenzo_concept1_site`,
branch `sandbox` (production IS the sandbox branch as of 2026-09-02 12:50).
**Database:** Supabase **LDTT** `ptnzaeprvkgjgtupmcty` (its own org). Never confuse
with `kudsexewnvprhsdcxzhy` (brighter day / DSN Command). Always pass the ref.

## Protected behaviours (verified working before this build)

1. **The office lead pipeline and its counts.** 152 leads across 13 real sources;
   dashboard donut, Leads table, reports and CSV export all read `allLeadRows()`.
   The only intentional change is that rows stamped `raw_payload.qa = true` are
   held out of every count (2 old "QA release verification" rows). Nothing else
   about Leads-tab numbers may move.
2. **The Sales tab starts EMPTY.** It shows only leads with
   `raw_payload.sales_pipeline = true` (bot-handled) plus trainer-submitted deals.
   It must never re-bucket existing leads by status — that would double-count
   against the Leads tab.
3. **Lead → client conversion trigger** `private.sync_client_from_converted_lead`
   fires on `became_client` and upserts `clients` on `lead_id`. 7,285 client rows.
4. **RLS on every table.** Admin policy uses `private.is_admin()`; trainer own-row
   policies use `private.is_active_portal_user()` + `private.current_trainer_id()`.
   New tables must follow the same pattern.
5. **Sandbox is read-only** (`lib/sandbox.js`, `LDTT_SANDBOX=1`): every write API
   calls `blockedInSandbox(res)` first and returns 423. New write endpoints must too.
6. **Communications hub**: claim/release/mark-contacted, closed-status list in
   `api/communications.js`, Resend sends (capped 100/day on free plan), Twilio
   webhooks in `api/webhooks/`. Do not touch template merge logic
   (`normalizeMergePlaceholders` / `mergeTemplate`) — it broke a live send on 2026-08-19.
7. **Trainer portal**: trainers see only their own leads/pages/submissions; they
   cannot reach `api/operational-mutation.js` (admin-only). Trainer writes go
   through their own endpoints (`submit-content-review.js`, now `submit-deal.js`).
8. **Portal auth**: `window.LDTT_PORTAL.accessToken()` for bearer tokens; demo
   login `admin` / `doglovers26` works offline when the API is unreachable.
9. **`.vercelignore` excludes `supabase/`** — migrations never deploy with the
   site. Apply them to LDTT via Supabase MCP / CLI, then deploy the code.
10. **Lead status vocabulary** is a DB CHECK constraint. `first_session_payment`
    was retired 2026-09-02 (0 live rows). Money detail lives on `deals`, not leads.

## Verification recipe (run before calling any change "done")

- `node --check trainer-backoffice/app.js api/*.js api/cron/*.js` all pass.
- Leads tab total = live `select count(*) from leads where coalesce((raw_payload->>'qa')::boolean,false) = false`.
- Sales tab shows 0 leads and 0 deals until a bot/test lead or deal exists.
- A trainer login sees no admin views (`canAccessAdminView('sales')` false for office_admin).
- `curl -s https://lorenzosdogtrainingteam.com/trainer-backoffice/app.js | grep -c SALES_STAGES` > 0 after deploy.
- Submit-deal rejects collected > sold with HTTP 400 and never writes.

## Meta pixel + Conversions API (added 2026-09-04, Claude)

11. **The Meta pixel is emitted by the generators, never pasted into HTML.**
    `build.py` (`META_PIXEL_HEAD`), `scripts/generate-market-pages.mjs` and
    `scripts/generate-trainer-opportunity-pages.mjs` all emit the same snippet.
    Every page with a `contact-intake` form carries it (97/97 on 2026-09-04).
12. **One event ID per lead, browser and server.** The head snippet stamps hidden
    `meta_event_id`, `fbp`, `fbc` into the form on submit and passes `eventID` to
    `fbq('track','Lead')`. `supabase/functions/submit-contact` sends the same
    event_id to `graph.facebook.com/v21.0/<pixel>/events` (`sendMetaConversion`).
    Meta de-duplicates on event_id, so a lead is never counted twice. The CAPI
    call is best-effort: it runs after the lead row is saved and can never fail
    the form response. It is a no-op until `META_CAPI_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set.
13. **QA rows never reach Meta.** `isQaSubmission` short-circuits the CAPI send.

Verification additions:
- `grep -c "eventID: id" dog-training-san-diego-ca.html` = 2 and
  `grep -l "fbq('track', 'Lead', { value: 250, currency: 'USD' });" *.html` = none.
- `node scripts/audit-office-requirements.mjs` passes (pixel checks included).
- `deno check supabase/functions/submit-contact/index.ts` passes.
- After deploying the function: `./scripts/deploy-meta-capi.sh --smoke` writes one
  qa-flagged lead and the function log shows `meta_capi_ok`.

## Staff portal typing safety net (added 2026-09-05, Claude, branch fix/missy-typing-wipe)

14. **Every box someone types into must be on the `typedFieldKey()` whitelist** in
    `trainer-backoffice/app.js` (`data-new-office-note`, `data-office-note-edit`,
    `data-client-note`, `data-submission-note`, `data-lead-search`,
    `data-application-search`, `data-client-search`, plus the design/flow fields).
    A box with an empty key is wiped by any `render()`. New typing fields must be added
    to that regex or they will regress Melissa's 2026-09-04 bug.
15. **"Add Office Note" empties its box before `render()`.** The safety net refills any
    typed box a redraw left empty, so a box still holding the saved wording would look
    unsaved. Keep the `textarea.value = ""` line before the repaint.
16. **The Applications screen draws `applicationDetailPanel()` exactly once**, at the
    `applications()` screen level. Drawing it inside the board or the table again makes
    the Add Recruiting Note button read a hidden duplicate textarea.
17. **Search focus comes back synchronously** (`restorePortalInputFocus()` calls `apply()`
    before the `requestAnimationFrame`). Moving it back to frame-only restore drops keys
    typed during the ~300 ms redraw.

Verification additions:
- `node scripts/audit-office-requirements.mjs` now carries four checks for the above (93 total).
- In the browser, with text in an office-note box: `render()` then `refreshOperationalData("poll"); flushPendingBackgroundRender()` must leave the text and focus in place.

## Vercel Web Analytics (added 2026-09-06, Claude)

36. **Every public page carries `<script defer src="/_vercel/insights/script.js"></script>` right before `</head>`.**
    Web Analytics was enabled on the Vercel project `ldtt-site` on 2026-09-06 (plan-included tier, $0) and
    production was redeployed from an exact copy of the live files plus this one line (98 pages; portal `app.js`
    untouched, md5 `035eb600`). `build.py`, `scripts/generate-market-pages.mjs` and
    `scripts/generate-trainer-opportunity-pages.mjs` emit the tag, so a rebuild keeps it. `generate-lp-test.mjs`
    copies its `<head>` from a tagged page and needs nothing. **Any release branch (e.g. `release/2026-09-05`) must
    carry the same line before it is deployed, or analytics goes dark again.**
    Check: `curl -sI https://www.lorenzosdogtrainingteam.com/_vercel/insights/script.js` is 200 and
    `grep -L _vercel/insights *.html` prints nothing. Rollback target if ever needed:
    `ldtt-site-9sixfsmxa` (prod before this change).

    **Speed Insights (same day):** every public page also carries
    `<script defer src="/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js"></script>` directly after the insights tag. Speed Insights
    was already enabled on the project (included tier; the "Plus" upgrade was NOT bought). Same generators emit it.
    Check: `curl -sI https://www.lorenzosdogtrainingteam.com/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` is 200.
    Neither script touches the portal, the leads table, or the dashboard numbers (rule 1).
